Batch_Admin is a script written by Artur Zgadzaj (original see:  http://www.itninja.com/blog/view/batch-run-as-administrator-automatically-with-highest-privileges-by-tools-batch-admin). It allows to automatically elevate the Administrator for use in any type of Batch own script, or BAT or .CMD or any program EXE or any internal system command. This function ensures the work on a standard environment, with standard tools and in the same way in different Windows systems. It uses several standard and built-in Windows commands. Do not use any other external scripts. It can be used to call any program as Administrator, not just scripts Batch. It suffices to create a small script, which then call the program that requires permission Administartor.
